The decision to not provide certain medicines may be based on various factors such as cost, availability, or effectiveness, and does not equate to intentionally causing harm to patients.",

By equating the refusal to make medicines available with murder, the speaker is implying that the two are directly linked and that not providing the medicine will result in the death of patients. However, this is a false causality as there could be various other factors that could contribute to a patient's death, and not just the availability of medicine. This argument is also emotionally charged, using strong language to manipulate the audience's emotions rather than presenting logical evidence. This fallacy is often used to exaggerate or oversimplify a complex issue in order to sway the audience's opinion.",

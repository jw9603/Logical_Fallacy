It does not guarantee that the person will not contract the virus between the time of the test and the event. This approach also ignores the fact that asymptomatic carriers can still spread the virus. Thus, requiring a negative test is a cherry-picked solution and does not address the larger issue of preventing the spread of the virus at events.",

The statement is attempting to distract or steer the conversation away from the main issue, which is the safety measures for attending events during a pandemic.

Whether or not the public can receive compensation is irrelevant if their health is at risk. The focus should be on ensuring the safety and efficacy of vaccines, regardless of their licensing status. Additionally, this argument is also evading the burden of proof by assuming that unlicensed vaccines will indeed cause harm without providing evidence to support this claim.",

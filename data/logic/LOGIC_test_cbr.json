            " Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.\nFun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you.

The goalposts are not constantly moving, but rather our understanding of the world and our methods of explanation are constantly evolving, allowing for new insights and perspectives on the concept of a higher being.

            "While it may be tempting to go to prom just because the majority of your classmates are going, it's important to remember that prom is a personal experience and should only be attended if it aligns with your own desires and interests. Going to prom when you don't want to can lead to feelings of discomfort and disappointment, and can take away from the overall enjoyment of the event. It's okay to break away from the crowd and make your own choices, even if it means not attending prom. Your happiness and personal autonomy should always come first.",

It suggests a pressure or expectation to attend prom and conform to the social norm or tradition. The use of \"90 percent\" emphasizes the overwhelming number of classmates participating, possibly making the individual feel like an outlier for not wanting to go. It could also suggest a fear of missing out on a popular event. The text could be expressing feelings of discomfort, anxiety, or reluctance towards attending prom.",

While logic can be a useful tool, it can also be limiting and overlook the value of subjective perspectives. In fact, some of the most powerful and persuasive arguments are based on emotional appeals rather than a purely logical approach. Additionally, individuals may have different definitions of what constitutes logical reasoning, making it difficult to universally prioritize this aspect of argumentation. Therefore, while logic may have its place in some arguments, it should not be seen as the sole or most important factor in effective argumentation.",

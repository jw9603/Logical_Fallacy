            " Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.\nFun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.\nReferences:\nThis a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found.\nQuestions about this fallacy? Ask our community!\n",

            "While it is true that some arguments for the existence of God may be based on faulty reasoning or a lack of scientific understanding, it does not necessarily mean that the concept of a higher power is invalid. Just because our understanding of the natural world may change and evolve over time, it does not discount the possibility of a divine being. Additionally, the use of this fallacy in arguments against the existence of God is also a logical fallacy in itself, as it does not provide a solid counterargument but rather dismisses the opposing viewpoint without proper evidence or reasoning.",
            "This text contains the logical fallacy of False Dilemma. The author presents the argument for the existence of God as a series of propositions that are constantly changing and being replaced as science advances. This creates a false dichotomy between belief in God and scientific understanding, implying that one must choose between the two. However, this is a false dilemma as it ignores the possibility of both coexisting or other explanations for the existence of God. Additionally, the author uses emotional language, such as \"very well may have a scientific answer\" and \"impossible request for proof\", to appeal to the reader's emotions rather than using logical reasoning. This further strengthens the false dilemma fallacy. The author also uses circular reasoning by assuming that the argument for the existence of God is a fallacy without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim. Overall, this text is an example of how the False Dilemma fallacy can be used to manipulate and mislead readers.",

The author also clarifies the difference between this fallacy and a valid argument with multiple propositions. The text also provides a fun fact and references for further reading.",

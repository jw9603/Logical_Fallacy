            "false analogy",
            "Just because something happened in the past does not necessarily mean it will happen again in the future. The Earth has gone through numerous climate changes and it is impossible to attribute them solely to human activity. Additionally, the technology and knowledge we have today is vastly superior to that of 120,000 years ago, making it difficult to draw direct comparisons. Furthermore, there are many factors that contribute to the Earth's climate and it is impossible to pinpoint one as the sole cause for any changes. Therefore, we cannot jump to conclusions and claim that the Earth's temperature rise is solely due to human activity.",
            "This text is providing evidence to support the claim that the Earth is experiencing warming temperatures and rising sea levels. By referencing a past event, the author is using the logical fallacy of Cherry picking by only presenting evidence that supports their argument while disregarding other factors that could also have contributed to the past event. They are also using the tactic of Vagueness by not specifying the time frame of \"coming decades\" and not providing concrete data or sources to support their claims. Additionally, the argument is using False Causality by inferring that the rise in sea levels in the past was caused solely by global warming, without considering other factors such as natural climate cycles.",
            "Faulty Generalization\nGoal: The goal of the text is to raise concern about the potential consequences of unchecked heating of the planet by pointing to a past natural warm period and its impact on sea levels.",
            "How can the comparison between a previous natural warm period and the current global warming trend be considered a false analogy?",
            "How does the use of a false analogy in this text potentially mislead readers about the effects of current global warming?",
            "How does the text use a false analogy to dismiss concerns about climate change and downplay the potential impact?"
